  # tableComponent
React component to display formatted data.

The purpose of this project is showing the minimal code needed to work a React component with basic configuration capabilities, without the distractions of setting up a bundler nor a set of helper libraries.
At the same time it shows the code as it could be seen in a development environment, with the benefits of ES6 code, previous to be transpiled.
